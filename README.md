# 2OP3_files_organizer

Organize lecture, assignment, and tutorial files for 2OP3. After downloading a lecture, tutorial, or assignment from a2l. Run this program to move them into the
folder u keep them in. If anyone know how to make it automatic, as it not having to run the file everytime please let me know.


Any tips to make it better are welcome :).
